NOTE: Loading from last checkpoint can only be done if game is started from the start, namely from the scene called "MainMenu3D_v3", and not if you change scene in unity
and die in the scene.

Add new checkpoint:
	1. Create a duplicate of one of the CP_XXX_YYY prefabs located in Asserts/Scripts/SaveLoad and change the name of the duplicate to:
	CP_LevelName_CheckpointNumber, like for example CP_Death_1 which is the first checkpoint in "death".
	
	2. Set "unique ID" to the unique name that you renamed the newly created duplicate to.
	
	3. Change scene to load to the name of the scene you want to load.
	
	4. Loading message is currently not used, but it should be the message displayed when level is being loaded.
	Spawn rotation is the rotation set on the player when loading using this checkpoint.

	5. Add object:
	Drag an interactable and write a state and the interactables puzzle state will be set to this when loading using this checkpoint.
	- After each interactable puzzle state has been set, puzzle event "onCheckpointLoaded" is called.
	
	6. Add inventory item:
	Write a string that is the name of the inventory thumbnail to add, and amount of this inventory type to add.
	- Inventory thumbnail names are located in a GameObject in the "MainMenu3D_v3" scene.

	7. Drag the newly created prefab into "LoadingManager" game objects component "Loading Menu" in the list called "Checkpoints Available". "LoadingManager" is located in "MainMenu3D_v3" scene.
	- The order in which elements are placed doesn't matter, but all checkpoints have to exist in the list to be able to load from them.
	
Using checkpoint in level:
	1. Locate CheckpointTrigger located in Asserts/Scripts/SaveLoad and drag it into the level (into hierarchy to create a game object using the prefab).
	
	2. Move the newly created CheckpointTrigger where you want it to trigger when entering it (You may change the size of the collider, or attach another collider).
	
	3. Drag the previously created Checkpoint (Which is also located in Assets/Scripts/SaveLoad) into CheckpointTriggers component called "CheckpointTrigger"
	into the field called "R_Checkpoint To Trigger".
	
	4. Enjoy your auto saved checkpoints!
