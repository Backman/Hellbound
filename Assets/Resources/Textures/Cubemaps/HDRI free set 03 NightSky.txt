This free set has been shot at the beginning of night, when the light is very low, lights are on, and the moon has to come. This way, you can use this to have some nice reflections on sky, and add whatever light you want to simulate the moon, or simply enlight your project as u need, without main light coming fomr the enviro!

A very special giveaway.

I hope u enjoy this, and leave your result in this topic! I'd like to see ur cretivity spreading everywhere! So, don't be shy, and share ur works!
