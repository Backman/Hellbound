NOTE: Loading from last checkpoint can only be done if game is started from the start, namely from the scene called "MainMenu3D_v3", and not if you change scene in unity
and die in the scene.

Add new checkpoint:
	1. Create a duplicate of one of the CP_XXX_YYY prefabs located in Asserts/Scripts/SaveLoad and change the name of the duplicate to:
	CP_LevelName_CheckpointNumber, like for example CP_Death_1 which is the first checkpoint in "death".
	THE NAME HAS TO BE UNIQUE OR IT WONT WORK!
	
	3. Loading message is currently not used, but it should be the message displayed when level is being loaded.
	
	4. Spawn rotation is the rotation set on the player when loading using this checkpoint.

	5. All interactables in the scene will be saved with their puzzle state.
	- When loading from a checkpoint, all interactables will have their puzzle state changed to what they had when checkpoint was used
	and puzzle event "onCheckpointLoaded" is triggered after states are set.

	6. Drag the newly created prefab into "LoadingManager" game objects component "Loading Menu" in the list called "Checkpoints Available". "LoadingManager" is located in "MainMenu3D_v3" scene.
	- The order in which elements are placed doesn't matter, but all checkpoints have to exist in the list to be able to load from them.
	
Using checkpoint in level:
	1. Locate the prefab that you created previously and drag it into hierarchy for a scene where it should be used.
	- A collider is attached to the game object, and it will trigger and save using the checkpoint when it is hit with the player.
	- You are free to edit the colliders size or attach another collider.
	
	2. Enjoy your auto saved checkpoints!
